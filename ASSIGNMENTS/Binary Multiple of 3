Given a binary number,  write a program that prints 1 if given binary number is a multiple of 3.  Else prints 0. The given number can be big upto 2^100

It is recommended to finish the task using one traversal of input binary string.

Input:
The first line contains T denoting the number of testcases. Then follows description of testcases. 
Each case contains a string containing 0's and 1's.
 

Output:
For each test case, output a 1 if string is multiple of 3, else 0.

Constraints:
1<=T<=100
1<=Length of Input String<=100


Example:
Input:
2
1001
100

Output:
1
0
