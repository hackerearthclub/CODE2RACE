The Euler totient function φ(N) is defined as the number of integers between 1 and N (inclusive) which are coprime with N.

You are given N and φ(N). Calculate the prime factorization of N.

Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and φ(N).
Output
For each test case, print a line containing a single integer K — the number of distinct prime factors of N. Then, print K lines. For each valid i, the i-th of these lines should contain two space-separated integers pi and ei denoting a prime divisor of N and its exponent. Specifically, the following conditions should hold:

N=∏Ki=1peii
pi<pi+1 for each valid i
ei>0 for each valid i
