# Question for practice
Joseph came across the next question , which asked him to check if the word spelt the same backwards .

A simple enough question , he started to solve the question only to be constrained by language allowed.

(Input a string (of character <80) from the user and print whether the string is a palindrome or not.

Assume no spaces between characters.) Sample Input: eergreejj

Sample Output: Not At All

(If it is a palindrome - print "Indeed")

SAMPLE INPUT 
eergreejj
SAMPLE OUTPUT 
Not At All
